# 4D Chess Game

This is a simple 4-Dimensional Chess game implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming. The game is structured with a 4D chess board and chess piece classes to manage the game environment, pieces, and their movements.

## Features

- **Chess Board Class:** The game utilizes a chess board class to represent the 4-dimensional chessboard. Game setup and movement of pieces is specified by this class.

- **Chess Piece Classes:** Different chess pieces are implemented as classes (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn) with inheritance from a base ChessPiece class.

- **Movement Functionality:** Chess pieces have movement rules defined, and the game enforces these rules when moving pieces.

- **Check/Checkmate Logic:** The game includes logic to check if a player's king is in check and to detect checkmate conditions.

## How to Play

1. Compile the C++ code provided.
2. Create a 4D chess board.
3. Initialize the board to setup the pieces.
4. Move pieces according to their rules.
5. Use the check and checkmate logic to determine the game's outcome.

This is by no means a final product and more updates are to come soon. Enjoy your 4D Chess game experience!
